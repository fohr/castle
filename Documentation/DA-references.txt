Reference counting in DA:
========= ======== == ==

- Clients
    - Live reference
    - Merge threads
    - Asynchornous T0 promotion

- Assumptions
    - Live reference is removed when marking DA for deletion.
    - DA is removed from hash when marking DA for deletion.
    - Holding DA hash lock or transaction lock guarantees that
        - DA is not getting destroyed.
        - Not being removed from hash table.
        - No CT is being unlinked.
    - CT's don't hold any reference on DA.
    - Each attachment increments the attachment counr on DA. DA can't be marked for deletion
      when DA is attached.
    - References just guarantee valid DA structure. No guarantee is given on associated CTs.
      DA-CT links would be protected by DA lock and transaction lock.
    - Could take references, even after DA is marked for deletion.
    - Sysfs accesses DA wihtout references, as we remove DA from sysfs before freeing DA
      structure.


Reference counting in CT:
========= ======== == ==

- Clients
    - Live reference
    - Writes, Reads, RQs

- Assumptions
    - Live reference is removed when last reference is removed.
    - Removed from hash only when last reference is removed.
    - No guarantees on DA pointer in CT, even with reference. Client has to make sure DA
      pointer would be valid.
    - ct->merge, merge_id, flags are valid only under ct->da->lock.
    - All the current clients(with references) are active only when there are live attachments,
      so DA should be valid.
    - Sysfs accesses CT without taking reference, as we remove CT from sysfs before removing
      from DA or hash.

- Cons
    - Starting a new merge thread needs to take a reference on CT and DA. But, DA is might have
      already gone by the time. CT need to hold a reference on DA.
